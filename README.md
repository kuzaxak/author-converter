P.S. I really hate reading from a laptop or a phone. I want to read the
books from a epaper screen, this is only one reason of this application.

#NB! Please made a donation to book author before download it (this is only a way to have good books)

then create a text file `curl.txt` and put content of the buffer there

After that you would be able to run 

```bash
